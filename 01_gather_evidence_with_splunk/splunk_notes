SPLUNK WORK FLOW

1. DATA OVERVIEW
//Basic overview of the data to understand the type of events and frequency of each:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| stats count by "Event Name"
| sort - count

**Note: Found a common User ID: ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE within the Event Name: HeadBucket and ListObjects
**Note: The User ID: accountId: ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE has only THAT parameter. Kind of sus. 


2. Analyze Specific Event Types
//Focus on the details of each event type, particularly any that involve access or modifications, such as 
//PutObject, ListObjects, or HeadBucket:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| stats count by "Event Name", "Source IP"
| sort - count

**Note: I found a that the there is a high count of Source IP's to the Event Names: HeadBucket and ListObjects
**Note: The Source IP's belong to the User ID: ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE, seems like a lead.


3. Identify Suspicious Source IPs
//Determine if there are any suspicious or anomalous access patterns based on source IP addresses:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| stats count by "Source IP"
| sort - count

**Note: There seems to be a high count of Source IP: 212.83.184.15 (ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE)
**Note: Unathorized Access: Chat explained that the identifier "ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE" typically points to actions attempted by users who are not authenticated. This might indicate eigther unauthenticated public access or, more concerningly, attempts to access your resources without proper credentials.

**Note: Frequent Activity from One Source: The fact that this 'User ID: ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE' correlates with the most active 'Source IP' suggests a pattern of behavior that is atypical and potentially malicious. This specific IP might be engaged in probing, scanning, or other forms of attack aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities.


4. User Agent Analysis
//Analyze the user agents involved in the requests to identify any patterns indicative of automated tools or scripts:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| stats count by "Request User Agent"
| sort - count

**Note: The output shows the highest count as Go-http-client/1.1 (Go Script) w/ 258/264 events being non-other thank ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE. 
**Note: The second highest count is Boto3/1.17.40 Python/3.6.12 Linux/3.10.0-1160.6.1.el7.x86_64 Botocore/1.20.112 and there are 110/110 events showing ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE.

5. Alarm and Alert Analysis
//Examine any alarms or alerts that have been triggered to identify potential security incidents:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| stats count by Alert, "Alarm DateTime"
| sort - count

**Note: I mean every click alerts and times are ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE


6. Temporal Analysis
//Check the distribution of events over time to spot any unusual spikes or patterns in activity:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| timechart span=1h count by "Event Name"

**Note: Spike in Event Names: HeadBucket, ListObjects from ANONYMOUS_PRINCIPLE at 2024-04-22 15:00 284/301 and 
2024-04-22 17:00 284/301



7. Request Parameters Analysis
Investigate the request parameters for any unusual or suspicious requests, especially those that might indicate attempts to exploit or probe the bucket:

index="main" source="AWS_S3_HoneyBucketLogs.csv" host="ubuntu"
| stats count by "Request Parameters"
| sort - count

**Note: 
'{'bucketName': 'microsoft-devtest', 'Host': 'microsoft-devtest.s3.amazonaws.com'}' (368 occurrences)
Interpretation: This is a straightforward access or query attempt on the microsoft-devtest bucket. The high frequency suggests that this bucket is a primary target for these requests, which could include simple metadata retrievals (HeadBucket) or more involved operations.
Concerns: High frequency might indicate automated scripts or tools checking the bucket's availability or permissions repeatedly.

**Note:
'{'list-type': '2', 'bucketName': 'microsoft-devtest', 'Host': 'microsoft-devtest.s3.amazonaws.com', 'encoding-type': 'url'}' (110 occurrences)
Interpretation: These parameters are used with the ListObjects API call, specifically indicating the use of version 2 of the listing type and URL encoding. This is typically used to retrieve the contents of the bucket in a structured manner.
Concerns: Listing objects in a bucket can be part of reconnaissance to understand what data is available, which could be a precursor to more targeted attacks or data breaches.
